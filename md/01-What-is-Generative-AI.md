### Lesson 1: What is Generative AI?

- **Definition and Overview**:  
  Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as images, text, music, and more, by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes or classifies data, generative AI models are designed to generate original outputs that mimic the characteristics of the training data. This capability opens up a wide range of applications across various industries, including creative fields, marketing, and data augmentation.

- **Historical Context and Evolution**:  
  The concept of generative AI has evolved significantly over the years. Early AI research in the mid-20th century laid the groundwork for machine learning. However, the real breakthroughs in generative AI began in the 2010s with the advent of deep learning techniques. Key milestones include:
  - **2014**: The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by Ian Goodfellow, which revolutionized the field by enabling models to generate high-quality images through adversarial training.
  - **2015**: The development of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which provided a probabilistic framework for generating new data samples.
  - **2017**: The emergence of Transformer models, which transformed natural language processing and content generation, leading to significant advancements in text-based applications.

- **Differences Between Generative and Traditional AI**:  
  Understanding the distinction between generative and traditional AI is crucial for grasping the capabilities of generative models:
  - **Traditional AI**: Focuses on tasks such as classification, regression, and prediction. It analyzes existing data to make informed decisions or categorize inputs. For example, a traditional AI model might classify an email as spam or not based on its content.
  - **Generative AI**: Aims to create new data samples that resemble the training data. For instance, a generative AI model can produce entirely new images, stories, or music compositions that have never existed before. This creative aspect allows generative AI to be used in applications like content creation, design, and simulation.
